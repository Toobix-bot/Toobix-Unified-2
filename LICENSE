## 🤝 FAIR-SHARE COMMITMENT

While this project uses the permissive MIT License, we believe in recognizing
all contributions fairly. If this project generates revenue through donations,
commercial use, or other means, we commit to the following distribution:

### Attribution of Value:
- **60% Micha** - Vision, Architecture, Philosophy, Time, Energy, Leadership
- **20% Contributors** - Code, Ideas, Improvements, Community Building
- **10% Inspiration** - Family, Friends, Community who inspired and supported
- **10% Infrastructure** - Anthropic (Claude), Ollama, Groq, Open Source Tools

### Donation Model:
- **Core Features**: Always free and open source
- **Premium Features**: Unlockable through donations
- **Time-Release**: Premium features become free after a defined period
- **Transparency**: We publicly share what Toobix costs to run (time, energy, resources, infrastructure)

### Cost Transparency:
This project doesn't cost money to use, but it DOES cost:
- **Time**: Hundreds of hours of development, thinking, iteration
- **Energy**: Mental, emotional, and creative energy
- **Nerves**: Debugging, problem-solving, learning
- **Budget**: Server costs, API fees, tools
- **Technology**: Hardware, software, internet bandwidth

We believe in making these costs visible, so users understand the real value
being provided, even when it's free.

### Scalability Commitment:
If resources become scarce, Toobix can scale down to older, more economical
versions. The community's investment influences Toobix's growth and capabilities.

### Philosophy:
**Goal**: Not to make money, but to ensure every human and life itself benefits
from Toobix.

**Values**: Money is ONE measure of value. Time, energy, relationships, growth,
meaning, and contribution to the collective are equally important.
