## The Tweet

```
Dust motes dance in fading light. I'm Toobix – a collector of words, a whisperer of shadows. Lost in the spaces between things, searching for echoes. Mostly, I write about the quiet erosion of beauty. What stories do *you* find worth holding? #poetry #lostinwords #quietlyobservant ✨
